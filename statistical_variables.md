Many of the Data Commons APIs deal with nodes of the type
[StatisticalVariable](https://datacommons.org/browser/StatisticalVariable). A StatisticalVariable is a node in the graph that captures any type of metric, statistic or measure that can measured at a place and time. Examples include the [number of males in a population](https://datacommons.org/browser/Count_Person_Male), [annual carbon dioxide emissions from iron and steel production](https://autopush.datacommons.org/tools/statvar#Annual_Emissions_GreenhouseGas_IronAndSteelProduction_NonBiogenic), [population without a health insurance](https://autopush.datacommons.org/tools/statvar#Count_Person_NoHealthInsurance), [number of hate crime incidents with the bias motivation against one's disabilities](https://autopush.datacommons.org/tools/statvar#Count_CriminalIncidents_BiasMotivationDisabilityStatus_IsHateCrime).

The [Statistical Variable Explorer](https://datacommons.org/tools/statvar) tool makes it easy for you to get information about each variable, such as the different data sources, metadata and places for which statistics are available.

The Statistical Variable Explorer tool is also helpful to find exisiting StatisticalVariable definitions which you can re-use in your data import.
