Many of the Data Commons APIs deal with nodes of the type
[StatisticalVariable](https://datacommons.org/browser/StatisticalVariable). A StatisticalVariable is a node in the graph that captures any type of metric, statistic or measure that can measured at a place and time. Examples include the [number of males in a population](https://datacommons.org/browser/Count_Person_Male), [population without health insurance](https://autopush.datacommons.org/tools/statvar#Count_Person_NoHealthInsurance) and the [annual Carbon Dioxide emissions from iron and steel production](https://autopush.datacommons.org/tools/statvar#Annual_Emissions_GreenhouseGas_IronAndSteelProduction_NonBiogenic).

The [Statistical Variable Explorer](https://datacommons.org/tools/statvar) tool makes it easy for you to find information about each variable, such as the different data sources, metadata and places for which the statistics are available.
