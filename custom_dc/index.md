## Overview

Data Commons is an open source platform. Every entity/organization can create
their custom Data Commons instance with their own data, customized website and
visualization tools.

A custom instance natively joins the base Data Commons data (from
datacommons.org) and the custom data in a unified fashion. Visualization and
data analysis across these data can be done seamlessly without further
alignment.

Custom Data Commons is deployed in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The owner has
full control over data, computing resources and access control. It can be
accessible by the general public or can be access controlled to limited
principals.

## Case Study

#### Feeding America Data Commons

[Feeding America Data Commons](https://datacommons.feedingamerica.org/) provides access to data from [Map the Meal Gap](https://map.feedingamerica.org/),
overlaid with data from a wide range of additional sources into a single
portal under a common scheme. Combining datasets from the CDC and Map the Meal gap, the correlation between
heart health and food insecurity can be retrieved with a few clicks.
