## Overview

Custom Data Commons is deployed in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The follow
manual presents how to install a custom Data Commons instance in an existing GCP
project (with id `PROJECT_ID`).

### Domain

The installation can use an existing domain, or create a default domain
`<PROJECT_ID>-datacommons.com`. This guide focuses on using the default domain.

### Steps

1. From [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), open Cloud
   Shell by clicking on the icon, like below:

   terminal:

   ```bash
   export PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
   export CONTACT_EMAIL=<email_address>
   ```

   Note: If this step fails, please contact support+custom@datacommons.org with
   the errors.

1. Please run the following installation command inside the terminal. This may
   take up to 20 minutes to complete.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacommonsorg/website/custom-dc-v0.1.0/scripts/install_custom_dc.sh -o install_custom_dc.sh && \
   chmod u+x install_custom_dc.sh && \
   ./install_custom_dc.sh
   ```

1. Please send an email to support+custom@datacommons.org with the following
   subject and message. Please replace <project_id> with the GCP project id from
   above steps.

   ```txt
    Subject: [Custom Data Commons Setup] <project_id> requires data access.

    Message:

    We are setting up a new custom Data Commons and would like to access
    the base layer of BT and BQ cache.
   ```

1. You should get an email by Google domains that has the section pictured

   Note: You may not get the verification email if you have verified Cloud
   Domains or Google Domains in the past. If you do not get the verification
   within 10 minutes, check GCP UI to see if the Cloud Domain is active. If it is
   active, then please skip this step. Below is what active Cloud Domains looks
   like.
