We've been hard at work since we [surfaced Data Commons in Google Search](https://docs.datacommons.org/2020/10/15/search_launch.html) last October. Some of the exciting features we've added include:


### Internationalization Support

Place Explorer is now available in 8 languages in addition to English: [German](https://datacommons.org/place/country/DEU?hl=de), [Spanish](https://datacommons.org/place/country/MEX?hl=es), [French](https://datacommons.org/place/country/FRA?hl=fr), [Hindi](https://datacommons.org/place/country/IND?hl=hi), [Italian](https://datacommons.org/place/country/ITA?hl=it), [Japanese](https://datacommons.org/place/country/JPN?hl=ja), [Korean](https://datacommons.org/place/country/KOR?hl=ko) and [Russian](https://datacommons.org/place/country/RUS?hl=ru). Additionally, support for these languages are carried forward from Google Search, [here's an example](https://www.google.com/search?hl=es&q=Poblaci%C3%B3n+de+M%C3%A9xico).


### New Graph Browser

The [Graph Browser](https://datacommons.org/browser) was rewritten from the ground up to be faster and more responsive. It includes search support for the growing number of [Statistical Variables](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/data/blob/master/docs/representing_statistics.md#intro-to-statisticalvariable-and-statvarobservation) available for each node, as well as redesigned to improve information density. Try it out for some nodes such as [India](https://datacommons.org/browser/country/IND), [Unemployment Rate in Boston](https://datacommons.org/browser/geoId/2507000?statVar=UnemploymentRate_Person) and [Renal Cell Carcinoma](https://datacommons.org/browser/dc/m28y35mxfwsdb).



### New Scatter Plot Explorer

The new [Scatter Plot Explorer](https://datacommons.org/tools/scatter) enables quick visual exploration of any two statistical variables for a set of places. Try it out for [Bachelor Degree Attainment vs Females per capita in California Counties](https://datacommons.org/tools/scatter#%26svx%3DCount_Person_Female%26svpx%3D0-8-0%26svdx%3DCount_Person%26svnx%3DFemale%26pcx%3D1%26svy%3DCount_Person_EducationalAttainmentBachelorsDegree%26svpy%3D2-0-6%26svdy%3DCount_Person_25OrMoreYears%26svny%3DBachelors_Degree%26pcy%3D1%26epd%3DgeoId%2F06%26epn%3DCalifornia%26ept%3DCounty) or [Covid-19 cases vs African Americans per capita among US States](https://datacommons.org/tools/scatter#%26svx%3DCount_Person_BlackOrAfricanAmericanAlone%26svpx%3D0-14-2%26svdx%3DCount_Person%26svnx%3DBlack_Or_African_American_Alone%26pcx%3D1%26svy%3DCumulativeCount_MedicalTest_ConditionCOVID_19_Positive%26svpy%3D5-2-0-1%26svdy%3DCount_Person%26svny%3DPositive%26pcy%3D1%26epd%3Dcountry%2FUSA%26epn%3DUnited%20States%20of%20America%26ept%3DState).



### API Documentation Refresh

We participated in the [2020 Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2020/participants/project-datacommons-kilimannejaro), working with Anne Ulrich ([@KilimAnnejaro](https://gist.github.com/KilimAnnejaro)) to completely [refresh and improve our API documentation](https://gist.github.com/KilimAnnejaro/722b353875241131b15866e0cf4ab7ea). Every API page was rewritten, in addition to [new Google Sheets API tutorials](https://docs.datacommons.org/tutorials/). We had a wonderful time collaborating with Anne on this project and hope the improved documentation enables more developers to harness the power of our APIs.



### New Stats API

We have also released a new set of APIs centered around statistics retrieval. There are different REST endpoints to retrieve [a single statistical value](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/rest/stat_value.html), [a statistical time series](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/rest/stat_series.html) or [the entire collection of statistical data for a set of places](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/rest/stat_all.html). We have used these APIs to build the new Scatter Plot Explorer and hope this enables other applications too.



### New Data

As always, we continue to add more data to the Data Commons Graph. Some recent additions include:
- Indian Census (e.g. [houseless](https://datacommons.org/browser/country/IND?statVar=Count_Household_Houseless_Rural) and [rural literacy](https://datacommons.org/browser/wikidataId/Q15116?statVar=Count_Person_Literate_Rural) populations)
- Reserve Bank of India's Poverty data (e.g. [rural population below poverty in Andhra Pradesh](https://datacommons.org/browser/wikidataId/Q1159?statVar=Count_Person_Rural_BelowPovertyLevelInThePast12Months))
- FDA and additional drug information (e.g. [drug](https://datacommons.org/browser/bio/CHEMBL512) from FDA, ChEMBL, PharmGKB, etc.)
- Improved Covid-19 statistics (e.g. [vaccination stats from ourworldindata.org](https://datacommons.org/browser/country/IND?statVar=CumulativeCount_Vaccine_COVID_19_Administered))
- US Energy Information Administration (e.g. [coal](https://autopush.datacommons.org/browser/country/USA?statVar=Quarterly_Consumption_Coal_ElectricPower) and [natural gas consumption](https://autopush.datacommons.org/browser/country/USA?statVar=Quarterly_Consumption_Fuel_ForElectricityGeneration_NaturalGas) for electricity)
- Expanded international data from World Bank (e.g., [crime](https://autopush.datacommons.org/browser/country/CHN?statVar=Count_CriminalActivities_MurderAndNonNegligentManslaughter_AsFractionOf_Count_Person), [health](https://autopush.datacommons.org/browser/country/IND?statVar=Count_Person_15OrMoreYears_Smoking_AsFractionOf_Count_Person_15OrMoreYears)[stats](https://autopush.datacommons.org/browser/country/IND?statVar=Count_Person_Upto4Years_Overweight_AsFractionOf_Count_Person_Upto4Years))
- Updated data from existing sources, including:
  - FBI Crime (till [2019](https://datacommons.org/browser/geoId/06?statVar=Count_CriminalActivities_ViolentCrime))
  - BLS Unemployment (till [2021 Q1](https://datacommons.org/browser/geoId/06?statVar=UnemploymentRate_Person))
  - World Bank (till [2019](https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+china&oq=population+of+china))



As always, we are eager to hear from you! Please [share your feedback](https://datacommons.org/feedback) with our team.
