# Data Commons documentation site

This repo hosts Data Commons API documentation
available at https://docs.datacommons.org/. The site is hosted in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## About Data Commons

[Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) is an open knowledge graph that
provides a unified view across multiple public data sets and statistics.
We've bootstrapped the graph with lots of
[data](https://datacommons.org/datasets) from US Census, CDC, NOAA, etc.,
and through collaborations with the New York Botanical Garden,
Opportunity Insights, and more. However, Data Commons is
meant to be for community, by the community. We're excited to work with you
to make public data accessible to everyone.

To see the extent of data we have today, [browse the Knowledge Graph](https://datacommons.org/browser).

## Markdown

The Data Commons documentation uses [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) Markdown.

## Navigation and breadcrumbs

The navigation bar and breadcrumbs are generated automatically from the YAML "front matter" at the top of each Markdown file, using the `parent`, `grand_parent` and `great_grand_parent` tags. See [Using YAML front matter](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-yaml-frontmatter) for details.

To disable a page from showing up in the navigation, use `exclude_from_nav: true`.

## Build locally

The documentation site is built using Jekyll. To run this locally:

1. One-time setup step: Install [Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
1. Run `bundle update`
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental`

You can continue to make local changes and just refresh the browser. You will need to rerun `bundle exec jekyll serve` if you make changes that affect the overall site, such as changes to YAML files, cross-page links, etc.

> **Tip:** If you want to make the staged site accessible to others (and not just on the loopback), add `--host 0.0.0.0` to the command. Then, users can access the site using the hostname of the machine where the site is running.

### One-time setup steps

This is a suggested way to set up your forks and remotes:

1. In https://github.com/datacommonsorg/docsite, click the **Fork** button to fork the repo.
1. Clone your forked repo to your desktop:
    <pre>git clone https://github.com/<var>USER_NAME</var>/docsite</pre>
    This adds your fork as the remote called `origin`.
1. Add `datacommonsorg/docsite` repo as a remote:
    <pre>git remote add <var>REMOTE_NAME</var> https://github.com/datacommonsorg/docsite.git</pre>
1. If this is your first time contributing to a Google Open Source project, follow the
steps in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to sign a CLA.

### Create a pull request

Every time you want to create a pull request, create a new branch and sync to the master branch:

<pre>
git checkout master
git pull <var>REMOTE_NAME</var> master
git checkout -b <var>BRANCH_NAME</var>
</pre>

Make your changes, and then create the PR as follows:

<pre>
git add .
git commit -m "<var>COMMIT_MESSAGE</var>"
git push -u origin <var>BRANCH_NAME</var>
</pre>

Then, in https://github.com, in your forked repo, you can create a pull request. You will need to assign at least one reviewer to approve.

Wait for approval of the pull request and merge the change.

> **Tip:** If you are working on multiple PRs/branches at a time, and switching between them, it's desirable to use `git switch --discard-changes` instead of `git checkout`. This prevents changes in the local work tree (committed or not) from automatically bleeding from one branch to another, and keeps the PR diffs clean.
