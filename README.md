# Data Commons Documentation Site

This repo hosts Data Commons API documentation
available at http://docs.datacommons.org/.

## About Data Commons

[Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) is an open knowledge graph that
provides a unified view across multiple public data sets and statistics.
We've bootstrapped the graph with lots of
[data](https://datacommons.org/datasets) from US Census, CDC, NOAA, etc.,
and through collaborations with the New York Botanical Garden,
Opportunity Insights, and more. However, Data Commons is
meant to be for community, by the community. We're excited to work with you
to make public data accessible to everyone.

To see the extent of data we have today, browse the graph using our
[browser](https://browser.datacommons.org/).
