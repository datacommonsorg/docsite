# Getting Started Guide

Welcome! Whether you're new to Data Commons or are just looking for a refresher, this guide gives an overview of what you need to know to get started using our REST API.

## What is a REST API?

Our REST API follows the [RESTful architectural style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) to allow you to query the Data Commons Knowledge Graph via [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods). This allows you to explore the local graph and query data from specific variables and entities programatically.

## How to Use the REST API

Our REST API can be used with any tool or language that supports HTTP. You can make queries on the command line (e.g. using [cURL](https://curl.se/)), by scripting HTTP requests in another language like javascript, or even by entering an endpoint into your web browser!

Following HTTP, a REST API call consists of a **request** that you provide, and a **response** from our servers with the data you requested in [JSON](https://json.org) format. The next section details how to assemble a request.

### Assembling a Request

#### Endpoints

Requests are made through [API endpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API#Endpoints). We provide endpoints for many different queries (see the list of available endpoints [here](/api/rest/v1)).

Each endpoint can be acessed using its unique URL, which is a combination of a base URL and the endpoint's [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

The base URL for all REST endpoints is:

```bash
https://api.datacommons.org
```

And a URI looks like [ `/v1/observation/point` ](/api/rest/v1/observation/point). To access a particular endpoint, append the URI to the base URL (e.g. `https://api.datacommons.org/v1/observation/point` ).

#### Parameters

Endpoints take a set of **parameters** which allow you to specify which entities, variables, timescales, etc. you are interested in. There are two kinds of parameters: path parameters and query parameters.

##### Path Parameters

Path parameters must be passed in a specific order as part of the URL. For example, `/v1/observations/point` requires the DCIDs of the entity and variable to query, in that order. This would look something like:

```bash
https://api.datacommons.org/v1/observations/point/entity_DCID/variable_DCID
```

##### Query Parameters

Query parameters are chained at the end of a URL behind a `?` symbol. Separate multiple parameter entries with an `&` symbol. For example, this would look like:

```bash
https://api.datacommons.org/v1/observations/point/variable_DCID/entity_DCID?date=YYYY&facet=XXXXXXXXXXX
```

Still confused? Each endpoint's documentation page has examples at the bottom tailored to the endpoint you're trying to use.

#### Finding Available Entities, Variables, and their DCIDs

Most requests require the [DCID](/glossary.html#dcid) of the entity or variable you wish to query. Curious what entities and variables are available? Want to find a DCID? Take a look at our explorer tools:

- [Search](https://datacommons.org/search) Search Data Commons
- [Graph Browser](https://datacommons.org/browser/) Click through the knowledge graph
- [Place Browser](https://datacommons.org/place) Summaries of data available for entities that are geographic locations
- [Statistical Variable Explorer](https://datacommons.org/tools/statvar) See metadata for variables

#### Finding Datetimes for Observations

Many endpoints allow the user to filter their results to specific dates. When querying for data at a specific date, the string passed for the date queried must match the date format (in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)) used by the target variable. An easy way to see what date format a variable uses is to look up your variable of interest in the [Statistical Variable Explorer](https://datacommons.org/tools/statvar).

### Bulk Retrieval

Many of our APIs come in both “simple” and “bulk” versions. The simple versions of endpoints have prefix `/v1/` and are designed for handling single requests with a simplified return structure. The bulk versions of endpoints have prefix `/v1/bulk/` and are meant for querying multiple variables or entities at once, and provide richer details in the response.

#### POST requests

Some bulk endpoints allow for `POST` requests. For `POST` requests, feed all parameters in JSON format. For example, in cURL, this would look like:

```bash
curl -X POST \
--url https://api.datacommons.org/v1/bulk/observations/point \
--data '{
  "entities": [
    "entity_dcid_1",
    "entity_dcid_2",
    ...
  ],
  "variables: [
    "variable_dcid_1",
    "variable_dcid_2",
    ...
  ]
}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Responses

#### "Method does not exist"
```json
{
  "code": 5,
  "message": "Method does not exist.",
  "details": [
    {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.DebugInfo",
      "stackEntries": [],
      "detail": "service_control"
    }
  ]
}
```
This is most commonly seen when the endpoint is misspelled or otherwise malformed. Check the spelling of your endpoint and that all required path parameters are provided in the right order.

#### "Invalid request URI"
```json
{
  "code": 3,
  "message": "Invalid request URI",
  "details": [
    {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.DebugInfo",
      "stackEntries": [],
      "detail": "internal"
    }
  ]
}
```
This is most commonly seen when your request is missing a required path parameter. Make sure endpoints and parameters are both spelled correctly and provided in the right order.

#### Empty Response


```json
{}
```
Sometimes your query might return an empty result. This is most commonly seen when the value provided for a parameter is misspelled or doesn't exist. Make sure the values you are passing for parameters are spelled correctly.

#### "Could not find field <field> in the type"
```json
{
 "code": 3,
 "message": "Could not find field \"variables\" in the type \"datacommons.v1.BulkVariableInfoRequest\".",
 "details": [
  {
   "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.DebugInfo",
   "stackEntries": [],
   "detail": "internal"
  }
 ]
}
```
This is most commonly seen when a query parameter is misspelled or incorrect. Check the spelling of query parameters.
