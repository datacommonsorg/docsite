# Data Commons REST API

The **Data Commons REST API** is a REST library that enables developers to
programmatically access nodes in the Data Commons knowledge graph. This package
allows users to explore the structure of the graph, integrate statistics from
the graph into data analysis applications and much more. Please see the
[overview](/api) for more details on the design and structure of the API.

Before proceeding, make sure you have followed the setup instructions below.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Data Commons REST API requires creating an API key and
enabling the **Data Commons API** on Google Cloud Platform.
Follow [the setup guide here](/api/setup.html).

You are now ready to go! From here you can view our tutorials on how to use the
API to perform certain tasks, or see a full list of calls available for use
in the left navigation menu.
