# Data Commons REST API

The **Data Commons REST API** is a REST library that enables developers to
programmatically access nodes in the Data Commons knowledge graph. This package
allows users to explore the structure of the graph, integrate statistics from
the graph into data analysis applications and much more. Please see the
[overview](/api) for more details on the design and structure of the API.
