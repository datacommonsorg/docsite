# Data Commons REST API 

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview

The Data Commons REST API is a
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) library
that enables developers to programmatically access data in the Data Commons
knowledge graph, using [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods). This allows you to explore the structure of the
graph, integrate statistics from the graph into data analysis applications and
much more.

You can use the REST API with any tool or language that supports HTTP. You can make queries on the command line (e.g. using [cURL](https://curl.se/)), by scripting HTTP requests in another language like Javascript, or even by entering an endpoint into your web browser!


## What's new in V2

The V2 API collapses functionality from [V1 API](/api/rest/v1) into a smaller number of endpoints, by introducing a syntax for _relation expressions_, [described below](#relation-expressions). Each API endpoint can also handle both single and bulk requests.

## Assemble a request

Following HTTP, a REST API call consists of a _request_ that you provide, and a _response_ from the Data Commons servers with the data you requested, in [JSON](https://json.org) format. The following sections detail how to assemble a request.

### Service endpoints

You make requests through [API endpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API#Endpoints). You access each endpoint using its unique URL, which is a combination of a base URL and the endpoint's [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

The base URL for all REST endpoints is:

<pre>
https://api.datacommons.org/<var>VERSION</var>
</pre>

The current version is `v2`.

To access a particular endpoint, append the URI to the base URL (e.g. `https://api.datacommons.org/v2/node` ).
The URIs for the V2 API are below:

| API | URI path | Description |
| --- | --- | ----------- |
| Node | [/v2/node](/api/rest/v2/node) | Fetches information about edges and neighboring nodes |
| Observation | [/v2/observation](/api/rest/v2/observation) | Fetches statistical observations |
| Resolve entities | [/v2/resolve](/api/rest/v2/resolve) | Returns a Data Commons ID ([`DCID`](/glossary.html#dcid)) for entities in the graph |
| SPARQL | [/v2/sparql](/api/rest/v2/sparql) | Returns matches to a [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) graph query |

### Parameters

Endpoints take a set of parameters which allow you to specify the entities, variables, timescales, etc. you are interested in. The V2 APIs only use query parameters.

### Query parameters

Query parameters are chained at the end of a URL behind a `?` symbol. Separate multiple parameter entries with an `&` symbol. For example, this would look like:

<pre>
https://api.datacommons.org/v2/node?key=<var>API_KEY</var>&nodes=<var>DCID1</var>&nodes=<var>DCID2</var>&property=<-*
</pre>

Still confused? Each endpoint's documentation page has examples at the bottom tailored to the endpoint you're trying to use.

### POST requests

All V2 endpoints allow for `POST` requests. For `POST` requests, feed all parameters in JSON format. For example, in cURL, this would look like:

<pre>
curl -X POST \
-H "X-API-Key: <var>API_KEY</var>" \
--url https://api.datacommons.org/v2/node \
--data '{
  "nodes": [
    "geoId/06085",
    "geoId/06086"
  ],
  "property": "->[name, latitude, longitude]"
}'
</pre>

### Find available entities, variables, and their DCIDs

Most requests require the [DCID](/glossary.html#dcid) of the entity or variable you wish to query. Curious what entities and variables are available? Want to find a DCID? Take a look at our explorer tools:

- [Search](https://datacommons.org/search) Search Data Commons
- [Knowledge Graph](https://datacommons.org/browser/) Click through nodes in the knowledge graph
- [Place Browser](https://datacommons.org/place) Summaries of data available for entities that are geographic locations
- [Statistical Variable Explorer](https://datacommons.org/tools/statvar) See metadata for variables


### Find date-times for observations

Many endpoints allow the user to filter their results to specific dates. When querying for data at a specific date, the string passed for the date queried must match the date format (in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)) used by the target variable. An easy way to see what date format a variable uses is to look up your variable of interest in the [Statistical Variable Explorer](https://datacommons.org/tools/statvar).

{: #authentication}
## Authentication

API keys are required in any REST API request. To include an API key, add your API key to the URL as a query parameter by appending <code>?key=<var>API_KEY</var></code>.

For GET requests, this looks like:

<pre>
https://api.datacommons.org/v2/<var>ENDPOINT</var>?key=<var>API_KEY</var>
</pre>

If the key is not the first query parameter, use <code>&key=<var>API_KEY</var></code> instead. This looks like:

<pre>
https://api.datacommons.org/v2/<var>ENDPOINT</var>?<var>QUERY</var>=<var>VALUE</var>&key=<var>API_KEY</var>
</pre>

For POST requests, pass the key as a header. For example, in cURL, this looks like:

<pre>
curl -X POST \
--url https://api.datacommons.org/v2/node \
--header 'X-API-Key: <var>API_KEY</var>' \
--data '{
  "nodes": [
    "<var>ENTITY_DCID1</var>",
    "<var>ENTITY_DCID2</var>",
    ...
  ],
  "property: "<var>RELATION_EXPRESSION</var>"
}'
</pre>

{: #get-key}
### Get API keys 

We provide a trial API key for general public use. This key will let you try the API and make single requests.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
   <b>Trial Key: </b>
   `AIzaSyCTI4Xz-UW_G2Q2RfknhcfdAnTHq5X5XuI`
</div>

_The trial key is capped with a limited quota for requests._ If you are planning on using our APIs more rigorously (e.g. for personal or school projects, developing applications, etc.) please request one by
[filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVCR95YOZ56ABsPwdH1tPAjjIeVDtisLF-8oDYlOxYmNZ7LQ/viewform) and selecting "API access" to request an official key without any quota limits. 

{: #pagination}
## Pagination

When the response to a request is too long, the returned payload is
_paginated_. Only a subset of the response is returned, along with a long string
of characters called a _token_. To get the next set of entries, repeat the
request with `nextToken` as an query parameter, with the token as its value.

For example, the request:

```
curl --request GET \
  'https://api.datacommons.org/v2/node?key=AIzaSyCTI4Xz-UW_G2Q2RfknhcfdAnTHq5X5XuI&nodes=geoId/06&property=<-*'
```

will return something like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "geoId/06": {
      "arcs": < ... output truncated for brevity ...>
    },
  },
  "nextToken": "SoME_veRy_L0ng_S+rIng"
}
```

To get the next set of entries, repeat the previous command and append the `nextToken`:

```
curl --request GET \
  'https://api.datacommons.org/v2/node?key=AIzaSyCTI4Xz-UW_G2Q2RfknhcfdAnTHq5X5XuI&nodes=geoId/06&property=<-*&nextToken=SoME_veRy_L0ng_S+rIng'
```

Similarly for POST requests, this would look like:

```json
curl -X POST \
-H "X-API-Key: AIzaSyCTI4Xz-UW_G2Q2RfknhcfdAnTHq5X5XuI" \
--url https://api.datacommons.org/v2/node \
--data '{
  "nodes": "geoId/06",
  "property": "<-*",
  "nextToken": "SoME_veRy_L0ng_S+rIng"
```

{: #relation-expressions}
## Relation expressions

Data Commons represents real world entities and data as nodes. These
nodes are connected by directed edges, or arcs, to form a knowledge graph. The
label of the arc is the name of the [property](/glossary.html#property).

Relation expressions include arrow annotation and other symbols in the syntax to
represent neighboring nodes, and to support chaining and filtering.
These new expressions allow all of the functionality of the V1 API to be
expressed with fewer API endpoints in V2. All V2 API calls require relation
expressions in the `property` or `expression` parameter.

The following table describes symbols in the V2 API relation expressions:

| ------ | ---------- |
| `->` | An `out` arc |
| `<-` | An `in` arc |
| <code>{<var>PROPERTY</var>:<var>VALUE</var>}</code> | Filtering; identifies the property and associated value |
| `[]` | Multiple properties, separated by commas |
| `*` | All properties linked to this node |
| `+` | One or more expressions chained together for indirect relationships, like `containedInPlace+{typeOf:City}` |

### In and out arcs

Arcs in the Data Commons Graph have directions. In the case of the [Argentina](https://datacommons.org/browser/country/ARG), the property `containedInPlace` exists in both `in` and `out` directions, illustrated in the following figure:

![](/assets/images/rest/property_value_direction_example.png)

Note the directionality of the property `containedInPlace`: for the node "Argentina", the `in` arc represents "Argentina contains Buenos Aires", while the `out` arc represents "Argentina in South America".*

Nodes from `out` arcs are represented by `->`, while nodes from
`in` arcs are represented by `<-`. To illustrate using the above example:

- Regions that include Argentina (DCID: `country/ARG`): `country/ARG->containedInPlace`
- All cities directly contained in Argentina (DCID: `country/ARG`): `country/ARG<-containedInPlace{typeOf:City}`

### Filters

You can use filters to reduce results to only match nodes with a specified property and value. Use {} to specify property:value pairs to define the filter. Using the same example, `country/ARG<-containedInPlace+{typeOf:City}` only returns nodes with the `typeOf:City`, filtering out `typeOf:AdministrativeArea1` and so on.

### Specify multiple properties

You can combine multiple properties together within `[]`. For example, in order to request a few `out` arcs for a node, use
`->[name, latitude, longitude]` (this example is fully described in this [Node API example](/api/rest/v2/node.html#multiple-properties)).

### Wildcard

To retrieve all properties linked to a node, use the `*`, e.g. `<-*`.
This example is fully described in this [Node API example](/api/rest/v2/node.html#wildcard).

### Chain properties

A property chain expression represents requests for information about nodes
which are connected by the same property, but are a few hops away. This is supported only for the `containedInPlace` property.
