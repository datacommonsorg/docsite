# Data Commons REST API

The Data Commons REST API is a
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) library
that enables developers to programmatically access data in the Data Commons
knowledge graph. This package allows users to explore the structure of the
graph, integrate statistics from the graph into data analysis applications and
much more.
