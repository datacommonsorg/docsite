# Show Triples Associated with Node(s)

## `datacommons.get_triples(dcids, limit=datacommons.utils._MAX_LIMIT)`

Given a list of nodes, return triples which are associated with the specified
node(s).

A knowledge graph can be described as a collection of *triples* which are
3-tuples that take the form *(s, p, o)*. Here, *s* and *o* are nodes in the
graph called the *subject* and *object* respectively, while *p* is the property
label of a directed edge from *s* to *o* (sometimes also called the *predicate*).

**Arguments**

*   `dcids (list of str)` - DCIDs to get triples for

*   `limit (int, optional)` - The maximum number of triples per combination of
    property and type associated with nodes linked by that property to fetch,
    â‰¤ 500.

**Returns**

A `dict` mapping DCIDs to a `list` of triples *(s, p, o)* where *s*, *p*, and *o* are
instances of `str` and either the *subject* or *object* is the specified DCID.

Each DCID is mapped to a list of triples, where a triple is an object with the
following fields. Note that not all fields are always included in each triple.

[comment]: <> (TODO: add link to data model and describe the fields in a Triple)

**Raises**

*   `ValueError` - If the payload returned by the Data Commons REST API is malformed.

## Examples

We would like to get one triple per property and type combination associated with
[California](https://datacommons.org/browser/geoId/06):

```python
>>> import datacommons as dc
>>> dc.set_api_key(YOUR_API_KEY_HERE)
>>> dc.get_triples(['geoId/06'], limit=1)
{
  'geoId/06': [
    ('geoId/0653', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/06', 'provenance', 'dc/sm3m2w3'),
    ('dc/p/zyjy2jq2xme02', 'location', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/06', 'containedInPlace', 'country/USA'),
    ('geoId/0686440', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/sch0699014', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/0686944', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/sch0699997', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('election/2024_S_CA00', 'location', 'geoId/06'),
    ('ipedsId/487597', 'location', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/sch0643380', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/06113011002', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/C49700', 'overlapsWith', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/0611593830', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/06U', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/06115', 'containedInPlace', 'geoId/06'),
    ('965EYosemiteAvenueSuite2MantecaCA95336', 'addressRegion', 'geoId/06'),
    ('geoId/06', 'typeOf', 'State')
  ]
}
```

If there is no node associated with the given DCID, an empty list is returned:

```python
>>> dc.get_triples(['foo'])
{'foo': []}
```
