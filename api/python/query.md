# Query the Data Commons Knowledge Graph using SPARQL

## `datacommons.query(query_string, select=None)`

Returns the results of running a graph query on the Data Commons knowledge graph
using [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/).

**Arguments**

*   `sparql (str)`: A SPARQL query string.

*   `select` (`func` accepting a row in the query result) - A function that
    selects rows to be returned by `query`. This function accepts a row in the
    results of executing `query_string` and return True if and only if the row
    is to be returned by `query`. The row passed in as an argument is
    represented as a `dict` that maps a query variable in `query_string` to its
    value in the given row.

This API only supports a subset of SPARQL keywords including:

<!--- TODO: add link to sparql doc --->

-   ORDER BY
-   DISTINCT
-   LIMIT

In the query, each variable should have a `typeOf` condition, e.g. `"?var typeOf
City ."`.

**Returns**

A table, represented as a `list` of rows, resulting from executing the given
SPARQL query. Each row is a `dict` mapping query variable to its value in the
row. If `select` is not `None`, then a row is included in the returned `list`
if and only if `select` returns `True` for that row.

**Raises**

*   `ValueError` - If the payload returned by the Data Commons REST API is malformed.

## Examples

**Examples**

We would like to query for the name associated with three states identified by
their DCIDs [California](https://datacommons.org/browser/geoId/06>),
[Kentucky](https://datacommons.org/browser/geoId/21>), and
[Maryland](https://datacommons.org/browser/geoId/24>).

```python
>>> import datacommons as dc
>>> dc.set_api_key(YOUR_API_KEY_HERE)
>>> query_str = '''
... SELECT ?name ?dcid
... WHERE {
...   ?a typeOf Place .
...   ?a name ?name .
...   ?a dcid ("geoId/06" "geoId/21" "geoId/24") .
...   ?a dcid ?dcid
... }
... '''
>>> result = dc.query(query_str)
>>> for r in result:
...   print(r)
{"?name": "Maryland", "?dcid": "geoId/24"}
{"?name": "Kentucky", "?dcid": "geoId/21"}
{"?name": "California", "?dcid": "geoId/06"}
```

Optionally, we can specify which rows are returned by setting `select`
like so. The following returns all rows where the name is "Maryland":

```python
>>> selector = lambda row: row['?name'] == 'Maryland'
>>> result = dc.query(query_str, select=selector)
>>> for r in result:
...   print(r)
{"?name": "Maryland", "?dcid": "geoId/24"}
```
