# _ENDPOINT_

One line summary of what it does. Can mostly copy from the REST V2 API docs.

Longer details if necessary can go in a short paragraph here. This is where to document any particular nuances in behavior or to provide special notes for end users. If thereâ€™s any special Data Commons terminology, link to the data_model and/or glossary docs rather than repeating the info here.
