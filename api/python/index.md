# Data Commons Python API

The **Data Commons Python API** is a Python library that enables developers to
programmatically access nodes in the Data Commons knowledge graph. This package
allows users to explore the structure of the graph, integrate statistics from
the graph into data analysis workflows and much more. Please see the [Data Commons API Overview](/api)
for more details on the design and structure of the API.

Before proceeding, make sure you have followed the setup instructions below.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Python API:

*   Install the API using `pip`.
*   Begin developing with the Python API

### Installing the Python API

First, install the `datacommons` package through `pip`.

```bash
$ pip install datacommons
```

For more information about installing `pip` and setting up other parts of
your Python development environment, please refer to the
[Python Development Environment Setup Guide](https://cloud.google.com/python/setup.html)
for Google Cloud Platform.

### Using the Python API

You are ready to go! From here you can view our [tutorials](/tutorials.html) on how to use the
API to perform certain tasks, or see a full list of functions, classes and
