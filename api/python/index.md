# Data Commons Python API

The **Data Commons Python API** is a Python library that enables developers to
programmatically access nodes in the Data Commons knowledge graph. This package
allows users to explore the structure of the graph, integrate statistics from
the graph into data analysis workflows and much more. 

Before proceeding, make sure you have followed the setup instructions below.

## Install the Python Data Commons API

1. If not done already, install python3 and pip3. See [Setting up a Python development environment](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/setup#installing_python) for procedures.
1. Use pip to install the `datacommons` package:

```bash
$ pip install datacommons
```

You are ready to go! You can start an interactive virtual environment using venv, you can view our [tutorials](/tutorials) on how to use the
API to perform certain tasks, or see a full list of functions, classes and
methods available for use in the sidebar.
