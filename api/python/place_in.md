# Get Places Contained within Another Place

## General information about this endpoint

**Signature**: `datacommons.get_places_in(dcids, place_type)`

**Required arguments**:

*   `dcids`: A list of nodes to query, identified by their DCID.
*   `place_type`: The type of the contained child `Places` within the given
    DCIDs to filter by.

## Assembling the information you will need for a call to the get_places_in method

Going into more detail on how to assemble the values for the required arguments:

 - `dcids`: Data Commons uniquely identifies nodes by assigning them DCIDs, or Data Commons IDs. Your query will need to specify the DCIDs for the nodes of interest.

 - `place_type`: This argument specifies the type of place sought in the response. For example, when examining places contained within American `States`, you would be able to select `City` or `County` (among others). For a full list of available types, see [`subClassOf Place`](https://datacommons.org/browser/Place).

## What to expect in the function return

The method's return value will always be a `dict` in the following form:

```python
{
    "<dcid>": ["string", ...]
    ...
}
```

## Example requests and responses

### Example 1: Retrieve a list of all counties in Delaware.

#### Method call

```python
datacommons.get_places_in(["geoId/10"], "County")
```

#### Response

```python
{'geoId/10': ['geoId/10001', 'geoId/10003', 'geoId/10005']}
```

### Example 2: Retrieve a list of congressional districts in Alaska and Hawaii.

```python
datacommons.get_places_in(["geoId/15","geoId/02"], "CongressionalDistrict")
```

#### Response

```python
{'geoId/15': ['geoId/1501', 'geoId/1502'], 'geoId/02': ['geoId/0200']}
```

## Error Returns

If there is no value associated with the requested property, an empty list is returned:

```python
>>> datacommons.get_places_in(["geoId/1021"], "CongressionalDistrict")
{'geoId/1021': []}
```

If you do not pass a required positional argument, a TypeError is returned:

```python
>>> datacommons.get_places_in(["geoId/1021"])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: get_places_in() missing 1 required positional argument: 'place_type'
```
