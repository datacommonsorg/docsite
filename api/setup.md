# Setting up access to the Data Commons API

## Creating an API Key

Using the Data Commons API requires you to provision an API key on Google Cloud
Platform (GCP). Follow these steps to create your own key.

1.  Start by creating a
    [GCP Project](https://console.developers.google.com/projectcreate) and
    [enabling billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
    for that project.
2.  After creating your project, you can navigate to the GCP Console to create
    an API key.

    -   Begin by navigating to **APIs & Services > Credentials** in the side bar
        or by clicking on this
        [link](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
    -   Click **Create Credentials** then select **API Key**.

    Once you do this, you'll be presented a key that you can copy to your
    clipboard.

## Enable the Data Commons API

Additionally, you will need to enable the **Data Commons API** on GCP. To enable
the API, do the following:

1.  Navigate to the [datacommons-users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/datacommons-users).
    Please join the group with the same Google account used to create the GCP
    project.
2.  Navigate to the
    [Data Commons API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/api.datacommons.org/overview)
    in the Google APIs Console.
3.  Click the **Enable** button and wait for the process to complete.
