# Get the value of a statistical variable at a given place and time.

## `=DCGET(dcids, variable, date)`

Given a list of [Place](https://datacommons.org/browser/Place) DCIDs, a [StatisticalVariable](https://datacommons.org/browser/StatisticalVariable), and a date, get the measurements of that variable at those places on that date.

**Arguments**
*   `dcids` - place DCIDs as a single value, a row, or a column
*   `variable` - The StatisticalVariable to get
*   `date` - The dates to observe in ISO 8601 format (e.g. 2017, "2017", "2017-12") or as a Google sheets [date value](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3092969?hl=en). This can be a single value, a row, or a column.

`date` is optional. If it's not specified, the function returns the latest observation of the variable.

**Returns**

The value of the variable at those places on the specified date (or on the latest available date, if no date is specified).

>  **NOTE:**
>
>  It's best to minimize the number of function calls to `DCGET` by using a single call to get a variable for a row/column of places and/or a column/row of times. This is because a spreadsheet will make one call to a Google server [per custom function call](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions#optimization). If your sheet contains thousands of separate calls to `DCGET`, expect it to be slow.

You can find a list of StatisticalVariables with human-readable names [here](/statistical_variables.html).

## Examples

### Get the total population of Hawaii in 2017.

```
=DCGET("geoId/15", "Count_Person", 2017)
```

### Get the population of multiple places with a single function call.

#### Input

### Get the population of a single place in multiple years.

#### Input
