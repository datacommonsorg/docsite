# Data Commons Sheets API

The **Data Commons Sheets API** is a Google Sheets add-on that enables Google Sheets
users to import data from the Data Commons knowledge graph. The add-on provides an
interface for finding the dcid of a location, as well as some custom functions for
importing data to a spreadsheet.

## Getting Started

The add-on is currently only available to users @google.com. Install it from G Suite Marketplace [here](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/data_commons/176057373416). It should work on any Google Sheet that you can edit.
