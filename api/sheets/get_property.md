# Retrieve node property values

The `=DCPROPERTY` formula returns values associated with the given property for a single [place](/glossary.html#place) [DCID](/glossary.html#dcid) or list of places.

## Formula

```
=DCPROPERTY(dcids, property)
```

### Required arguments

* `dcids`: A single [place](/glossary.html#place) node or range of cells representing nodes, identified by their [DCIDs](/glossary.html#dcid).
* `property`: The label of the [property](/glossary.html#property) whose value you are interested in,  such as `name` for the name of a node, or `typeOf` for the type of a node. If you aren’t sure what properties are available for a particular DCID, you can use the [Data Commons Knowledge Graph](https://datacommons.org/browser/){: target="_blank"} to look up the DCID of interest and see what properties it is associated with.

### Returns

The values of the property label for the specified DCIDs.

## Examples
