# Get the values of a given property for a node.

## `=DCPROPERTY(dcids, property)`

Given a property, together with a single DCID, a row of DCIDs, or a column of DCIDs, get the values of the given property for those DCIDs.

**Arguments**
*    `dcids` - DCIDs to get the property for
*    `property` - property to get

**Returns**

The properties of the DCIDs. For a single DCID, the result is a column of the given property's values for that DCID. For a row of DCIDs, the result is a matrix where each column contains the values of the given property for the DCID at the column's index. For a column of DCIDs, the result is a matrix where each row contains the values of the given property for the DCID at the row's index.

## Examples

In this example, we find the `containedInPlace` of the Data Commons nodes for [California](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06) and [Mountain View](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/0649670). The function call in the image uses a single call to get the names of both nodes, but it is equivalent to typing:

```
=TRANSPOSE(DCPROPERTY("geoId/06", "containedInPlace"))
```

and

```
=TRANSPOSE(DCPROPERTY("geoId/0649670", "containedInPlace"))
```

in cells B1 and B2 respectively.
