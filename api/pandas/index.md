# Data Commons Pandas API

The **Data Commons Pandas API** is a superset of the Data Commons Python API:
all functions from the Python API are also accessible from
the Pandas API, and supplemental functions help with directly creating
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
objects using data from the Data Commons knowledge graph for common pandas
use cases. Please see the [Data Commons API Overview](/api) for more details
on the design and structure of the API.

Before proceeding, make sure you have followed the setup instructions below.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Pandas API:

*   Install the API using `pip`.
*   Begin developing with the Pandas API

### Installing the Pandas API

First, install the `datacommons_pandas` package through `pip`.

```bash
$ pip install datacommons_pandas
```

For more information about installing `pip` and setting up other parts of
your Python development environment, please refer to the
[Python Development Environment Setup Guide](https://cloud.google.com/python/setup.html)
for Google Cloud Platform.
