# Data Commons Pandas API

The **Data Commons Pandas API** is a superset of the Data Commons Python API:
all functions from the Python API are also accessible from
the Pandas API, and supplemental functions help with directly creating
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
objects using data from the Data Commons knowledge graph for common pandas
use cases. Please see the [Data Commons API Overview](/api) for more details
on the design and structure of the API.

Before proceeding, make sure you have followed the setup instructions below.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Pandas API:

*   Install the API using `pip`.
*   (Optional) Create an API key and enable the **Data Commons API**.
*   Begin developing with the Pandas API

### Installing the Pandas API

First, install the `datacommons_pandas` package through `pip`.

```bash
$ pip install datacommons_pandas
```

For more information about installing `pip` and setting up other parts of
your Python development environment, please refer to the
[Python Development Environment Setup Guide](https://cloud.google.com/python/setup.html)
for Google Cloud Platform.

### Creating an API Key (Optional)

If you would like to provide an API key, follow the steps in [the API setup
guide](/api/setup.html). Data Commons *does not charge* users, but uses the
API key for understanding API usage.

With the API key created and Data Commons API activated, we can now get started
using the pandas API. There are two ways to provide your key
to the pandas API package.

1.  You can set the API key by calling `datacommons_pandas.set_api_key`.
    Start by importing `datacommons_pandas`, then set the API key like so.

    ```python
    import datacommons_pandas as dcpd

    dcpd.set_api_key('YOUR-API-KEY')
    ```

    This will create an environment variable in your Python runtime called
    `DC_API_KEY` holding your key. Your key will then be used whenever
    the package sends a request to the Data Commons graph.

1.  You can export an environment variable in your shell like so.

    ```python
    export DC_API_KEY='YOUR-API-KEY'
    ```

    After you've exported the variable, you can start using the Data Commons
    package.

    ```
    import datacommons_pandas as dcpd
    ```

    This route is particularly useful if you are building applications that
    depend on this API, and are deploying them to hosting services.
