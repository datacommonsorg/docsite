# Contribute to Data Commons!

Data Commons has benefited greatly from our collaborations with different government organizations and academic institutions and are looking to expand the set of collaborative projects. In particular, we are looking for partners to:

- [Create tools](#creating-a-new-tool): Build new tools or applications that bring the data in Data Commons to new categories of users.
- [Create new curriculum](#sharing-analysis): Using Data Commons in data science and machine learning courses.
- [Write documentation](#updating-documentation)

Data Commons welcomes patches and contributions to this project from everyone, new or experienced!

## Getting started

### Signing the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

### Becoming familiar with the project

You can read about our [data models](/data_model.html) and explore existing data
and tools on [datacommons.org](https://datacommons.org/).

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. Data Commons
uses GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

This project follows Google's [code style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/), [documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style), and [open source community guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

Your addition to the tutorial page should look like this when raw:

```

    [Google Colab](<YOUR COLAB LINK HERE>){:target="_blank"}, [Github](<YOUR GITHUB .IPYNB FILE HERE>){:target="_blank"}
```
