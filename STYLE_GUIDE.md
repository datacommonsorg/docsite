## Pluralizing nodes in Data Commons

When describing a place or `Place`, be careful to distinguish between Data Commons `Place` objects and places that one might visit, and use the appropriate styling for each. Here are two sample sentences that illustrate the distinction:

Sarah loves travelling to many new places.
Sarah should call the API by specifying DCIDs associated with the `Place` objects whose populations she wishes to measure.

When describing more than one Data Commons `Class` (for example, two `Place` objects or three instances of `StatisticalVariable`), do not pluralize them. Instead, use terminology like five `Count` measurements or eight `Observation` occurrences.
