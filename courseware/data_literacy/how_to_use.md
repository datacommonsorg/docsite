# How to use the course materials

The curriculum is organized in self-contained modules. Instructors (and students) are welcome to consume or work through any of the modules or the components within any module. Each [module](modules.html) is available as a detailed document with several pedagogical notes, objectives and an outline/table of contents to allow easy navigation.

To find what you may be looking for, or to use any content in your own courses/curriculum, we recommend the following approach:

1. Navigate to the [Key Themes pages](key_themes.html). It lists several key themes along with some pointers to specific modules which have the complete details.

1. Navigate to the [Modules page](modules.html). For each module, we describe its goal and include its table of contents. If you find what you are looking for (e.g., search "categorical vs numeric variables" and you should find yourself at the second module), you can then access the module directly for the content.
