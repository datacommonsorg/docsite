## Overview

"Data Literacy with Data Commons" comprises curriculum/course materials for instructors, students and other practitioners working on or helping others become _data literate_. This includes detailed modules with pedagogical narratives, explanations of key concepts, examples, and suggestions for exercises/projects focused on advancing the _consumption_, _understanding_ and _interpretation_ of data in the contemporary world. In our quest to expand the reach and utility of this material, we assume no background in computer science or programming, thereby removing a key obstacle to many such endeavors.

For more background about the course, see our [FAQs](faqs.html) page.

### FERPA Compliance 

Data Commons collects no personal information (PII), records, or private information from users and can be used in compliance with [FERPA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html){: target="_blank"}. For specific questions about FERPA compliance, please contact your organization’s legal counsel for advice. 


### Objectives

We embarked on a mission to imagine a Data Literacy curriculum aimed at anyone and everyone who consumes data and aspires to correctly understand and interpret it to help with better decision-making.

We list the following core objectives of such a curriculum:

- Exposing students (and practitioners) to the basics of data comprehension and interpretation.
- Introducing some basic and intermediate data-driven decision making concepts.
- Explicitly cater to the needs of students (and practitioners) who have no prior programming experience and a limited exposure to basic statistical concepts.
- Adopt a narrative-based approach to appeal to a wide range of audiences.
- Grounding most/all examples and illustrative assignments on real data.
- Using as many of the out-of-the-box and freely available data exploration tools to preclude any advanced or specialized knowledge.
- Make the curriculum materials openly available and support extensive customizations for any instructors who wish to adopt components/modules to suit their needs.

### Suggested Prerequisites

We suggest only the following prerequisites for this curriculum:

- High-School level Mathematics (basic).
- High-School level Statistics (basic).

### Feedback

Data Literacy with Data Commons is constantly a work in progress and we aim to keep making additions and complete the "TBD" modules over time.
