# Course Materials

The Data Literacy course curriculum is structured into a series of modules, which can be explored in the following ways:

- [Key Themes](key_themes.html) lists several key themes along with some pointers to specific modules which have the complete details. You can use search (Ctrl + F) on this page to search for a term or topic you are interested in.
- [Modules](modules.html) describes and links all available (and planned) modules along with their tables of contents. You can search for topics here as well and/or access the modules directly to explore.
- [How to Use](how_to_use.html) describes a general (recommended) process for navigating these pages and the course content.

If you do not find the topic/concept you are looking for, please email us at [courses@datacommons.org](mailto:courses@datacommons.org) with suggestions about topics/concepts to add. If you would like to contribute to this endeavor, please do reach out at [courses@datacommons.org](mailto:courses@datacommons.org) and help us add more content.
