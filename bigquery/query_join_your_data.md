# Query Category: Joining with Your Own Data

### Using [FIPS](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html) codes

Join with Fatal Accidents report from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (source: [Google Cloud Public Datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/nhtsa-data/nhtsa-traffic-fatalities?project=) to compute counties with highest fatal accidents per capita. Winner is Loving County, TX (the least populated county in main US), followed by Kenedy County, TX.

```sql
WITH FatalAccidents AS (
SELECT
  CONCAT(LPAD(CAST(NHTSA.state_number AS STRING), 2, '0'), LPAD(CAST(NHTSA.county AS STRING), 3, '0')) AS FIPS,
  COUNT(consecutive_number) AS Count
FROM `nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016` AS NHTSA
GROUP BY FIPS)
SELECT P.id AS CountyId,
       P.name AS CountyName,
       IF(Obs.value IS NOT NULL, FA.Count / CAST(Obs.value AS FLOAT64), NULL) AS FatalAccidentsPerCapita
FROM FatalAccidents AS FA
JOIN `data_commons.Observation` AS Obs ON TRUE
JOIN `data_commons.Place` AS P ON TRUE
WHERE
  P.id = Obs.observation_about AND
  P.geo_id = FA.FIPS AND
  Obs.variable_measured = 'Count_Person' AND
  Obs.is_preferred_obs_across_facets
ORDER BY FatalAccidentsPerCapita DESC
```

### Using Zip codes

Join with [Project SunRoof](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/project-sunroof/project-sunroof) data to compute solar potential for low-income Zip codes. In the lowest income 500 zips, this query computes those with the most solar-potent places (among those that were sufficiently qualified). Of the 500, 133 of them had > 50% potential.

```sql
WITH LowestEarnerZips AS (
    SELECT Obs.observation_about AS PlaceId,
           Obs.Value AS Income
    FROM `datcom-external.data_commons.Observation` AS Obs
    WHERE
        Obs.is_preferred_obs_across_facets AND
        Obs.variable_measured = 'Median_Income_Person' AND
        Obs.observation_about LIKE 'zip/%'
    ORDER BY CAST(Value AS FLOAT64)
    LIMIT 500)
SELECT SunRoof.region_name AS Zip, SunRoof.state_name AS State, SunRoof.percent_qualified AS PercentSunRoof
FROM LowestEarnerZips AS DC
JOIN `datcom-external.project_sunroof.solar_potential_by_postal_code` AS SunRoof ON TRUE
WHERE CONCAT('zip/', SunRoof.region_name) = DC.PlaceId AND
      SunRoof.percent_qualified > 0 AND
      SunRoof.percent_covered > 80
ORDER BY PercentSunRoof DESC
```

### Lat-Long based join

From [OpenStreetsMap public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/openstreetmap/geo-openstreetmap), we get all fire-hydrants associated with lat/lng and compute the US counties with the most number of hydrants per unit area using geographic join. Winner is Alexandria County Virginia by a distance.

```sql
WITH CountyFireHydrantCount AS(
  WITH FireHydrantLocations AS (
    SELECT geometry AS Geo
    FROM  `openstreetmap_public_dataset.planet_nodes` AS node
    JOIN UNNEST(all_tags) AS tags
    WHERE (tags.key = 'emergency' AND tags.value = 'fire_hydrant'))
  SELECT PB.id AS CountyId, COUNT(*) AS NumHydrants
  FROM `data_commons.PlaceBoundary` AS PB
  JOIN `data_commons.Place` AS P ON TRUE
  JOIN FireHydrantLocations ON TRUE
  WHERE
    P.id = PB.id AND
    EXISTS(SELECT * FROM UNNEST(P.all_types) AS T WHERE T = 'County') AND
    ST_WITHIN(FireHydrantLocations.Geo,
              ST_GEOGFROMGEOJSON(PB.geo_json_coordinates, make_valid => TRUE))
  GROUP BY CountyId)
SELECT P.id AS CountyId,
       P.name AS CountyName,
       CountyFireHydrantCount.NumHydrants /
             (SUBSTR(P.land_Area, 12) AS INT64) AS HydrantsPerSqMeter
FROM `data_commons.Place` AS P
JOIN CountyFireHydrantCount ON TRUE
WHERE
  P.id = CountyFireHydrantCount.CountyId AND
  STARTS_WITH(P.land_area, 'SquareMeter')
ORDER BY HydrantsPerSqMeter DESC
```
