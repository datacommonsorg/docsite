# Query Data Commons using SQL with BigQuery

The Data Commons repository is available as BigQuery tables in the [Analytics Hub](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/analytics-hub/exchanges(analyticshub:projects/841968438789/locations/us/dataExchanges/data_commons_17d0b72b0b2/listings/data_commons_1803e67fbc9){: target="_blank"}). If you have a Google Cloud Platform account, you can use Analytics Hub to issue SQL queries against the Data Commons tables. For more information, see the [Analytics Hub introduction](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction){: target="_blank"}. 

> **Note:** Analytics Hub is no longer being updated with Data Commons data, and the Data Commons tables may be turned down. If you want to continue to use this, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pqliyxlfb4Mle2a77TLdl_LPxRKdQF5uG86pKC9MDu4/edit?resourcekey=0-icbp8ZymR520Rq-r4tEajQ) to tell us about your use case.

**Tip:** Before you start, you may find it helpful to review Data Commons [key concepts](/data_model.html).

In these pages are sample SQL queries grouped together by category. You can copy and paste the queries into the BigQuery Studio in the Cloud Console.
