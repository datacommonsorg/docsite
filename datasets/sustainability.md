#### [Energy Information Adminsitration](https://www.eia.gov/)
* EIA's [Open Data](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php) provides county, state, and plant-level data on  generation, consumption, and sales for different energy sources and "sectors" (residential, commercial, etc). Data Commons has imported data about coal, electricity, natural gas, nuclear outages, and petroleum.
* The [EIA-860](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/) survey form collects generator-level data about electric power plants.

#### [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov)
* [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/greenhouse-gas-overview): Annual reporting of greenhouse gases from large emission sources.
* [Air Data](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data): Air quality data collected from outdoor monitors on the county, CBSA, and site monitor level.

#### [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov/)
[Center for Climate Simulation](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/): Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections for CMIP5 ([NEX-DCP30](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-dcp30) and [NEX-GDDP](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp)) and [CMIP6](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp-cmip6), which contains atmospheric variables from multiple climate models. Data Commons has aggregated the data for countries and for a 0.5 degree resolution grid, as well as for counties in the US, Europe, and Indian subcontinent.

#### [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/)
* [National Climatic Data Center Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp): occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce; rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; and other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event.
* [NOAA International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=ib-v4-access): The IBTrACS project provides tropical cyclone best track data in a centralized location. Data Commons includes cyclone name, start date, end date, max wind speed, minimum pressure, max classification, oceanic basin, and affected places.
