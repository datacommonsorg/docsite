#### [Experimental Data](https://www.encodeproject.org/help/project-overview/)
The ENCODE experimental dataset contains information for approximately 7000 experiments along with 14,000 BED files collected by The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium. Examples of experiment metadata captured include the target biosample, assay type, gene assembly, etc. Data Commons include the meta data for all experimental datasets in ENCODE as of 2019.

Data made available under: [ENCODE Data Use Policy for External Users](https://www.encodeproject.org/help/citing-encode/). This data was formatted for Data Commons through a collaboration with Dr. Anthony Oro’s group at Stanford University.

### [Gene Ontology Consortium](https://geneontology.org/)

#### [The Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org/)
"The Sequence Ontology is a set of terms and relationships used to describe the features and attributes of biological sequence. SO includes different kinds of features which can be located on the sequence. Biological features are those which are defined by their disposition to be involved in a biological process. Examples are 'binding site' and 'exon'. Biomaterial features are those which are intended for use in an experiment such as aptamer and PCR_product. There are also experimental features which are the result of an experiment. SO also provides a rich set of attributes to describe these features such as 'polycistronic' and 'maternally imprinted'."

### [International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)](https://ictv.global/)

#### [Master Species List](https://ictv.global/msl)
The official, current virus taxonomy approved by the ICTV. To accomplish the task of organizing and maintaining this virus taxonomy, the ICTV is composed of 7 subcommittees covering Animal DNA viruses and Retroviruses, Animal dsRNA and ssRNA (-) viruses, Animal ssRNA (+) viruses, Bacterial viruses, Archaeal Viruses, Fungal and Protist viruses, and Plant viruses. The ICTV has established over 100 international Study Groups (SGs) covering all major virus families and genera. The MSL version currently in the graph is MSL38 v3 released on 2023-09-11.

#### [Virus Metadata Resource](https://ictv.global/vmr)
The ICTV chooses an exemplar virus for each species and the VMR provides a list of these exemplars. An exemplar virus serves as an example of a well-characterized virus isolate of that species and includes the GenBank accession number for the genomic sequence of the isolate as well as the virus name, isolate designation, suggested abbreviation, genome composition, and host source. The VMR version currently in the graph is VMR MSL38 v2 released on 2023-09-13.

#### [USAN Stems](https://www.ama-assn.org/about/united-states-adopted-names/united-states-adopted-names-approved-stems)
 USAN stems represent common stems for which chemical and/or pharmacologic parameters have been established. These council-approved stems and their definitions are recommended for use in coining new nonproprietary drug names belonging to an established series of related agents. USAN appropriately incorporates this established class stem system. By doing so, similar compounds maintain a common "family" name that provides immediate recognition.

### [U.S. National Institutes of Health: National Center for Biotechnology Information (NIH: NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

#### [NCBI Assembly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly)
"The [NCBI Assembly database](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/) provides stable accessioning and data tracking for genome assembly data. The model underlying the database can accommodate a range of assembly structures, including sets of unordered contig or scaffold sequences, bacterial genomes consisting of a single complete chromosome, or complex structures such as a human genome with modeled allelic variation. The database provides an assembly accession and version to unambiguously identify the set of sequences that make up a particular version of an assembly, and tracks changes to updated genome assemblies. The Assembly database reports metadata such as assembly names, simple statistical reports of the assembly (number of contigs and scaffolds, contiguity metrics such as contig N50, total sequence length and total gap length) as well as the assembly update history. The Assembly database also tracks the relationship between an assembly submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Consortium (INSDC) and the assembly represented in the NCBI RefSeq project" (Kitts et al. 2016). In this import we include the metadata for all genome assemblies documented in `assembly_summary_genbank.txt` and `assembly_summary_refseq.txt`. Assemblies are stored in GenomeAssembly nodes whose information is integrated from both the GenBank and RefSeq datasets.


#### [NCBI Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene)
"[NCBI Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) supplies gene-specific connections in the nexus of map, sequence, expression, structure, function, citation, and homology data. Unique identifiers are assigned to genes with defining sequences, genes with known map positions, and genes inferred from phenotypic information. These gene identifiers are used throughout NCBI's databases and tracked through updates of annotation. Gene includes genomes represented by [NCBI Reference Sequences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) (or RefSeqs) and is integrated for indexing and query and retrieval from NCBI's Entrez and [E-Utilities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/) systems. Gene comprises sequences from thousands of distinct taxonomic identifiers, ranging from viruses to bacteria to eukaryotes. It represents chromosomes, organelles, plasmids, viruses, transcripts, and millions of proteins."


#### [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/)
"NCBI Taxonomy "consists of a curated set of names and classifications for all of the source organisms represented in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). The NCBI Taxonomy database contains a list of names that are determined to be nomenclaturally correct or valid (as defined according to the different codes of nomenclature), classified in an approximately phylogenetic hierarchy (depending on the level of knowledge regarding phylogenetic relationships of a given group) as well as a number of names that exist outside the jurisdiction of the codes. That is, it focuses on nomenclature and systematics, rather than documenting the description of taxa."

#### [Disease Ontology](https://disease-ontology.org/)
The Disease Ontology was developed as a project by the Institute of Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. It "is a community driven, open source ontology that is designed to link disparate datasets through disease concepts". It provides a "standardized ontology for human disease with the purpose of providing the biomedical community with consistent, reusable and sustainable descriptions of human disease terms, phenotype characteristics and related medical vocabulary disease concepts".

### [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/)

#### [ATC Codes](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/)
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) is a heirarchical classification system for pharmacological substances. 'In the ATC classification system, the active substances are classified in a hierarchy with five different levels. The system has fourteen main anatomical/pharmacological groups or 1st levels. Each ATC main group is divided into 2nd levels which could be either pharmacological or therapeutic groups. The 3rd and 4th levels are chemical, pharmacological or therapeutic subgroups and the 5th level is the chemical substance. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th levels are often used to identify pharmacological subgroups when that is considered more appropriate than therapeutic or chemical subgroups.'
