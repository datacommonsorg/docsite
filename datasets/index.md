# Data coverage

Data in the Data Commons Graph comes from a variety of sources, each of which often includes multiple surveys. Some sources/surveys include a very large number of variables, some of which might not yet have been imported into Data Commons. The sources have been grouped by category and can found in detail at <https://datacommons.org/data/>. In terms of global coverage, the data ranges from global to country, state, and district levels. The following charts illustrate the coverage, by number of statistical variables, at each level.

The first chart illustrates the total number of statistical variables available per country, excluding the USA where data coverage is currently most extensive.
